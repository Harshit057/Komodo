# LMODEL
Language Model (LM) Implementation & Analysis
🚀 Exploring the Capabilities of Language Models (LM) using NLP & ML

This project involves selecting, implementing, and analyzing a Language Model (LM) to understand its performance, capabilities, and limitations. The implementation is done in Jupyter Notebook with a step-by-step guide for testing and evaluation.

Features & Objectives
✅ Model Selection – Implemented GPT-2 (or your chosen model) using Hugging Face Transformers.
✅ Text Generation – Evaluates how the model generates text and understands context.
✅ Performance Analysis – Tests different prompts and analyzes output quality.
✅ Research Questions – Investigates contextual understanding, creativity, and adaptability.
✅ Visualization – Uses charts and graphs to interpret LM behavior.
